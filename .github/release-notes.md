## Riff 0.3.2 🎵

Adds `riff-update` — update Riff with a single command. It fetches the latest source into ~/.cache/riff, skips the rebuild when you are already current, and reinstalls the same way you originally installed (pacman package rebuild via makepkg, or the install.sh virtualenv). `riff-update --force` rebuilds regardless.
A native YouTube Music player for CachyOS / Arch Linux (GTK4 + libadwaita + mpv).

### Highlights
- Stream songs, albums, artists and playlists from YouTube Music — no ads, no account
- Radio autoplay: when the queue runs out, related songs keep playing
- Queue with shuffle, repeat (off/all/one), play-next and add-to-queue
- Favorites, listening history and local playlists (SQLite)
- Offline downloads via yt-dlp
- Lyrics for the current song
- MPRIS2 integration: media keys, GNOME/KDE widgets, `playerctl`
- Stream prefetching for instant track changes

### Install on CachyOS / Arch

```bash
paru -S python-ytmusicapi          # AUR dependency
git clone https://github.com/aimdi/player.git
cd player/packaging && makepkg -si
```

or without makepkg: `./install.sh`

The attached wheel can also be installed directly (system deps: `gtk4
libadwaita python-gobject mpv`):

```

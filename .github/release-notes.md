## Riff 0.14.0 🎵

**Spotify playlists, the Spotube way.** Menu → *Import from Spotify…*: paste any public Spotify playlist or album link — Riff reads the track list from Spotify (anonymously, no account or API key) and matches every song on YouTube Music into a local playlist, with duration-aware matching so you get the real recordings, not sped-up covers. One-click classics included (Today's Top Hits, RapCaviar, lofi beats, …); re-import any time to pull playlist updates.

### What’s new since 0.8.0

#### Video (0.12)
- **In-app music video** plays in the cover-art slot (GStreamer + muted video; mpv keeps audio)
- Toggle video from the now-playing cover when a video stream is available

#### Playlist folders (0.10–0.11)
- **Spotify-style folders** — create from sidebar **＋ New**, nest playlists, expand/collapse
- Drag-and-drop playlists into folders; move from the Playlists page
- **Colored folder badges** with custom emoji; right-click folder menu
- Flat badge style aligned with desktop folder icons

#### Home & AI (0.9–0.11)
- **For you** strip on Home — AI picks when a provider/local model is ready, else smart radio from history
- **Local AI** — in-process GGUF (no Ollama); model picker (Qwen, Llama, Gemma) with a recommended default
- Clickable now-playing title/cover → album; artist name → artist page

#### Library & UX (0.8.1–0.8.2)
- **Add** on public playlists — one-click local snapshot
- Icons that stay visible on CachyOS / elementary / Breeze dark themes
- Stable player-bar height for video thumbnails

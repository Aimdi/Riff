## Riff 0.3.1 🎵

AI Mix now supports **OpenAI-compatible endpoints** alongside Anthropic: pick the provider in Settings and point it at OpenAI, OpenRouter, Groq, or a fully local server (Ollama at http://localhost:11434/v1 with an empty key, LM Studio, …) with your own base URL, key, and model. Implemented over plain HTTP — no extra package required; tolerates servers without JSON response-format support.
A native YouTube Music player for CachyOS / Arch Linux (GTK4 + libadwaita + mpv).

### Highlights
- Stream songs, albums, artists and playlists from YouTube Music — no ads, no account
- Radio autoplay: when the queue runs out, related songs keep playing
- Queue with shuffle, repeat (off/all/one), play-next and add-to-queue
- Favorites, listening history and local playlists (SQLite)
- Offline downloads via yt-dlp
- Lyrics for the current song
- MPRIS2 integration: media keys, GNOME/KDE widgets, `playerctl`
- Stream prefetching for instant track changes

### Install on CachyOS / Arch

```bash
paru -S python-ytmusicapi          # AUR dependency
git clone https://github.com/aimdi/player.git

The attached wheel can also be installed directly (system deps: `gtk4
